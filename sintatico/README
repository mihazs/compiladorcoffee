pyParsing is a parsing toolkit which can parse strings of LL(1) grammars.

This library is for learning purpose only, for efficient and convenient parsing techniques have a look at ply, 
a pure python implementation of lex and yacc.

Though the parser is fully functional (includes a tokenizer), there is much work to be done in terms of usability.
Look at the documentation in /doc (to be written) for more information on this module.

######################## To Do ###########################

# add auto elemination of left recursion, 
  auto left factoring of the grammars
# error recovery techniques
# add attribute passing mechanisims 
# better way of eading user input. current way of taking the grammar specs
  from the user is too clunky and error prone. Have to make this better
# A graphical animation support, to visualize the parsing. 
  since this library is mainly for learning purpose, this would be great!!
